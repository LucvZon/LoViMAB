# -------------------------------------------------------------------
#          CONFIGURATION FOR TARGETED ASSEMBLY WORKFLOW
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
 
# --- Sample Configuration ---
# List your samples here. The key is the sample name (e.g., "Sample1"),
# and the value is the path and prefix of the input fastq files.
# The workflow will find all *.fastq.gz files in your path.
samples:
  Sample1: "/path/to/input/reads/"
  # Sample2: "path/to/input/reads/"
 
# --- External Databases ---
# Fill in the absolute paths to your databases and scripts.
paths:
  # Database for initial read classification
  diamond_db: "/path/to/diamond/database.dmnd"
  # Database for CheckV
  checkv_db: "/path/to/checkv/"
 
# --- Assembler Selection ---
# Set to 'true' to run an assembler, or 'false' to skip it.
assemblers:
  metaflye: true
  penguin: true
  raven: true
  canu: true
  myloasm: true
  metamdbg: true
  wtdbg2: true
  shasta: true
  miniasm: true
  # Add other assemblers if needed

# --- REASSEMBLY ---
# Aggregate assemblers contigs and reassemble
reassembly:
  reassemble_contigs: true
 
# --- General Parameters ---
params:
  threads: 24

  # --- PENGUIN ---
  # Minimum contig length
  penguin_min_contig_len: 1000
  # Minimum sequence identity for overlaps
  penguin_min_seq_id: 0.95
  
  # --- CANU ---
  # Set genome size for canu
  canu_genome_size: 200k

  # --- MYLOASM ---
  myloasm_min_reads: 10
  myloasm_min_overlap: 250

  # --- METAMDBG ---
  metamdbg_min_overlap: 250
  metamdbg_min_seq_id: 0.95

  # --- WTDBG2 ---
  wtdbg2_min_read_len: 400
  wtdbg2_min_contig_len: 1000

  # --- SHASTA ---
  shasta_min_read_len: 400

  # --- MINIASM ---
  miniasm_min_overlap: 250

  # --- CAP3 ---
  cap3_overlap_len: 250
  cap3_identity_pct: 95

  # --- DIAMOND ---
  # Set DIAMOND BLASTX sensitivity for read filtering
  # options: fast, mid-sensitive, sensitive, more-sensitive, very-sensitive, ultra-sensitive
  diamond_sensitivity: sensitive

# --- Virus Selection (Optional) ---
# Add any viruses you want to specifically deep-dive on (e.g. for QUAST comparison).
# If you leave this empty or comment it out, the workflow will still run statistics
# and CheckV, but will skip the targeted reference-based comparisons.
viruses_of_interest:
  # Key: A species name for the virus (must match the name in the DIAMOND database)
  # Value: Path to the reference FASTA for that virus
  # Virus_name_1: "path/to/reference/genome"
  # Virus_name_2: "path/to/reference/genome"
