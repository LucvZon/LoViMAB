## Read Filtering

After quality control, a total of **{total_read_count}** reads remained.

Following classification against the human virus database, **{target_read_count}** reads were selected for assembly.

This represents **{reads_leftover_pct}%** of the quality-controlled reads.

## Contig Quality (CheckV)

The following tables summarize the quality of viral contigs produced by each assembler, as determined by CheckV.

### CheckV Quality Categories

```{{r}}
#| label: tbl-checkv-quality
#| tbl-cap: "Counts of contigs per CheckV-defined quality category."
#| echo: false

# Construct the filename for this specific sample's summary
csv_path <- paste0("{sample_name}", "_checkv_summary.csv")
checkv_data <- read.csv(csv_path, check.names = FALSE)
knitr::kable(checkv_data, format = "html")
```

### MIUViG Quality Categories

```{{r}}
#| label: tbl-miuvig-quality
#| tbl-cap: "Counts of contigs per MIUViG-defined quality category."
#| echo: false

# Construct the filename for this specific sample's summary
csv_path <- paste0("{sample_name}", "_miuvig_summary.csv")
miuvig_data <- read.csv(csv_path, check.names = FALSE)
knitr::kable(miuvig_data, format = "html")
```
